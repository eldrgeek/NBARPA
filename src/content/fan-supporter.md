## Support the Players Who Gave Us Everything

For years, NBA players have given us unforgettable moments, inspired our dreams, and brought communities together. Now, as they transition to life after basketball, it's our turn to support them. Learn how you can make a difference in the lives of the players who made a difference in ours.

## The Reality of Life After Basketball

### Behind the Highlights
While we see the glamorous side of NBA life, the reality for many retired players is challenging:

- **60% of NBA players** face financial difficulty within 5 years of retirement
- **Average career length**: Just 4.5 years
- **Mental health struggles**: 26% experience depression post-retirement
- **Identity crisis**: 83% struggle with "Who am I without basketball?"
- **Physical challenges**: Chronic pain affects 78% of retired players

### Why Players Need Our Support
- **Sudden transition** - From spotlight to everyday life overnight
- **Limited preparation** - Many enter NBA at 19-20 years old
