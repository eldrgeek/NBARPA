## Supporting Your Player Through Every Season

As the family member of an NBA player, you experience the unique joys and challenges of professional basketball from a different perspective. You're the constant through trades, injuries, wins, losses, and eventually, retirement. This journey affects you too, and we're here to support you.

## Understanding the Journey

### The Hidden Challenges Families Face
- **Frequent relocations** - Average of 3-4 moves during a career
- **Public scrutiny** - Living in the spotlight affects the whole family
- **Financial pressure** - Managing sudden wealth and requests for money
- **Time apart** - Road games, training camps, and seasons abroad
- **Identity shifts** - From "player's spouse/family" to finding your own path

### The Transition Impact on Families
- **60% of NBA marriages** end within 5 years of retirement
- **Children of players** often struggle with identity and pressure
- **78% of players** experience financial stress within 2 years of retirement
- **Family dynamics** change dramatically when the player is home full-time
