## 📖 Example Usage

```typescript

} from './src/lib/firebase';

// Get player's complete career
const career = await getPlayerCareer('player-id');
// Returns: [{team: "CLE", season: "2003-04", games: 79}, ...]

// Get team roster for a specific season
const roster = await getTeamRoster(14, 64); // Lakers 2009-10
