### 4. player_team_seasons (Junction Table)
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Data Cleaning  
**Records**: 26,342 records (in unmatched_pts.csv)  
**Source**: `../NBA Database/nba_data/unmatched_pts.csv`

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_team_seasons (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    team_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(team_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    season_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES seasons(season_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    games_played INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(player_id, team_id, season_id)
);
```

**Current Format (Unmatched):**
```csv
player_name,team_abbr,season_year,season_id,games_played,reason
Jayson Tatum,Team.BOSTON_CELTICS,2023,77,74,"Player: ‚úì, Team: ‚úó"
Joel Embiid,Team.PHILADELPHIA_76ERS,2023,77,66,"Player: ‚úì, Team: ‚úó"

```

**Problem**: Team names don't match
- Current format: `Team.BOSTON_CELTICS`
- Need format: `BOS` (from teams.csv)

**Target Format:**
```csv
player_id,team_id,season_id,games_played
123,2,77,74
456,23,77,66
789,7,77,66
```

## Next Steps

See these documents for implementation:
- **`DATABASE_IMPORT_ANALYSIS.md`** - Detailed technical analysis
- **`IMPORT_ACTION_PLAN.md`** - Quick action plan

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Review this table overview
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Decide on database platform (PostgreSQL recommended)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Choose data cleaning approach (transform vs. re-scrape)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Set up database and begin Phase 1 imports
