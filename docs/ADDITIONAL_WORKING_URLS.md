- ‚úÖ `/about` not `/who-we-are/about-us/`
- ‚úÖ `/board` not `/who-we-are/board-of-directors/`
- ‚úÖ `/join` not `/membership/player-membership/`
- ‚úÖ `/staff` not `/who-we-are/team/staff/`

### www Subdomain Pattern:
- Some pages work with or without `www.`

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION

1. **Update CORRECTED_URL_MAPPING.md** with these new findings
2. **Replace broken links** with working alternatives:
   - Use `/board` instead of `/who-we-are/board-of-directors/`
   - Use `/join` instead of `/membership/player-membership/`
   - Use `/login` for member portal access
   - Use `/about` for general information

3. **Add new useful links:**
   - `/media/videos` for video content
   - `/staff` for team/contact information
   - `/donate` for simplified donation links

4. **Continue exploration** to find program pages (health, funding, etc.)

## NOTES

- Many pages exist at simpler URLs than expected
- Site structure is flatter than assumed
- Always test both with and without `www.`
- Player program pages may truly not exist publicly
  - May require login/member access
  - May need to use contact form instead

---

**Next Conversation Should:**
1. Use these newly discovered URLs
2. Continue exploring for program pages
3. Update all 8 files with correct links
4. Test everything manually
5. Document final URL mappings
