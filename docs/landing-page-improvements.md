# RPA Connect Landing Page & User Flow Improvements

## Executive Summary
This document outlines strategic improvements for the RPA Connect platform's landing page and overall user experience. The recommendations focus on enhancing user engagement, clarifying the value proposition, and streamlining the user journey from initial visit to active participation.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Clear branding with "RPA Connect" identity
- Five distinct user pathways (Retired, Active, Family, Business, Fan)
- Integration with Five Pillars framework
- Tour functionality for new users
- Responsive design with mobile support

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Value Proposition Clarity**: The connection between RPA Connect and user benefits needs stronger articulation
2. **User Journey Confusion**: Multiple entry points without clear hierarchy
3. **Engagement Metrics**: No visible social proof or success stories
4. **Call-to-Action Hierarchy**: Tour button competes with journey selection
5. **Navigation Complexity**: Dropdown menus may hide important options

## Proposed Improvements

```
Current: Generic welcome message
Proposed: Dynamic, personalized hero with rotating success stories
```

**Implementation:**
- Add video background featuring player testimonials

```
