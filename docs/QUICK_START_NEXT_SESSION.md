## üîß FILES TO FIX (8 files, 31 broken links)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Links Are ALREADY in These Files!
**Your task is to UPDATE/REPLACE the existing broken URLs, not add new links.**

**These files already have `<a href="...">` tags with broken URLs that need fixing:**

```
src/pages/PillarHealthPage.tsx         - 3 broken links TO UPDATE
src/pages/PillarFinancePage.tsx        - 4 broken links TO UPDATE
src/pages/PillarCommunityPage.tsx      - 1 broken link TO UPDATE
src/pages/RetiredPlayerPage.tsx        - 12 broken links TO UPDATE
src/pages/ActivePlayerPage.tsx         - 4 broken links TO UPDATE
src/pages/BusinessPartnerPage.tsx      - 1 broken link TO UPDATE
src/pages/FamilyMemberPage.tsx         - 4 broken links TO UPDATE
src/pages/FivePillarsPage.tsx          - 2 broken links TO UPDATE
```

**How to Fix:**
1. Open each file
2. Search for "legendsofbasketball.com" 
3. Replace broken URLs or remove links
4. Use working URLs from the list above

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Quick Wins (10 min)
Replace these broken URLs with working alternatives:

```bash
# Find and replace in all files:
/who-we-are/board-of-directors/  ‚Üí  /board
/membership/player-membership/    ‚Üí  /join
```

### Step 2: Remove/Replace Health & Finance Links (20 min)
Since `/player-programs/*` doesn't exist:

**Option A (Recommended):** Remove the links entirely  
**Option B:** Replace with contact form: `/contact/`  
**Option C:** Keep only general pages: `/membership/`, `/who-we-are/`

### Step 3: Test Everything (10 min)
```bash
# Run the URL checker
./check_urls.sh

# Or manually check each updated link
```

### Step 4: Explore More (30 min)
Look for additional valid landing pages:
- Click through site navigation
- Check footer links
- Look for programs/services section
- Document any new working URLs

---

## üîç EXPLORATION PRIORITIES

### Must Find (if they exist):
1. Health & Wellness programs page
2. Financial assistance/grant programs page
3. Scholarship information page
4. Events calendar or listings
5. Player profiles or directory

### Where to Look:
- Main navigation menu dropdowns
- Footer "Quick Links"
- /membership/ page content
- /who-we-are/ page content
- /about page content
- Try `/programs`, `/services`, `/resources`

---

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Site uses SIMPLE URLs**: `/about` not `/who-we-are/about-us/`
2. **Some need www**: Test both with and without
3. **Programs may be private**: Might require login
4. **When in doubt**: Use `/contact/` as fallback

---

## üìù TESTING COMMANDS

```bash
# Test a single URL
curl -I -s -L -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "URL" --max-time 10

# Test multiple URLs
./check_urls.sh

# Explore new paths
./explore_legends_site.sh
```

---

## ‚ú® SUCCESS METRICS

When done:
- [ ] Zero 404 errors when users click links
- [ ] All links verified working (200 status)
- [ ] Documentation updated with final URL list
- [ ] Code committed with meaningful message

---

## üìû IF YOU GET STUCK

1. Check `HANDOFF_URL_VERIFICATION_PROJECT.md` for full context
2. Review `ADDITIONAL_WORKING_URLS.md` for latest discoveries
3. Use Conservative approach: remove broken links, keep working ones
4. Add fallback: "Contact NBRPA for program details"

**START HERE:**  
Open `ADDITIONAL_WORKING_URLS.md` and begin replacing broken links with the newly discovered working alternatives!

**Good luck! üöÄ**
