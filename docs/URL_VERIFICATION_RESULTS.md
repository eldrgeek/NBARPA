## CRITICAL FINDINGS

1. **No "player-programs" section exists** - All health, wellness, and funding program URLs are broken
2. **No "events" section exists** - All event calendar and specific event URLs are broken
3. **Membership sub-pages don't exist** - Only the main membership page works
4. **Most sub-pages are 404s** - The site has a much flatter structure than assumed

## NEXT STEPS NEEDED

1. Navigate to the actual website and explore the navigation menu
2. Find where program information is actually located
3. Determine if programs are:
   - On different URL paths
   - Combined into general pages
   - Not publicly available online
   - Behind login/member areas
4. Create corrected URL mapping
5. Update all links in the RPA Connect codebase

## URL REPLACEMENTS NEEDED

**CRITICAL:** Before updating code, need to find actual URLs or determine fallback strategy for:
- Health & Wellness programs
- Financial assistance programs (grants, scholarships)
- Events calendar
- Membership sub-pages
- Player profiles
- Chapters information
