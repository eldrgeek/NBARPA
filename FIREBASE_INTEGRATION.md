# Firebase Integration Documentation

## Overview

This project has been integrated with Firebase/Firestore for data persistence and analytics tracking. The integration includes:

- **4,775 NBA players** imported from the NBA Database

Stores NBA player data imported from the NBA Database:
```typescript
{
  full_name: string
  nicknames: string
  position: string
  birth_date: string
}
```

#### **assessments**
Stores completed player assessments:
```typescript
{
  player_id: string          // Matched player ID (if found)
  player_name: string         // Entered name
  timestamp: Timestamp
  assessment_data: FormData   // Complete assessment responses
  status: 'completed' | 'in-progress'
}
```

#### **analytics**
Tracks global metrics:
```typescript
{
  total_players_connected: number

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Environment Variables
Located in `.env.local`:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=***
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=mike-wolf.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=mike-wolf
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=mike-wolf.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=***
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=***

```

### NPM Scripts
```bash
# Import NBA players to Firestore
npm run firebase:import

# Deploy Firestore rules
npm run firebase:deploy

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Firestore Rules
**Current Status**: Open for development (deployed to production)

**Location**: `firestore.rules`

```javascript
// Players: Read/Write allowed (for development)
// Assessments: Read + Create allowed
// Analytics: Read/Write allowed
// Admin Logs: Read/Write allowed
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: In production, you should restrict write access using Firebase Authentication.

## üìä Data Flow

### Assessment Submission Flow:
```
1. User enters name ‚Üí Autocomplete suggestions appear
2. User selects or continues ‚Üí Player resolution via fuzzy matching
3. User completes assessment ‚Üí All form data collected
4. User clicks "Save to Database" ‚Üí 
   - Assessment saved to Firestore
   - Analytics counter incremented
   - Admin log created
5. Success confirmation shown with Assessment ID
```

### Analytics Tracking:
- **Assessments**: Auto-incremented when saved
- **Players Connected**: Can be manually tracked via `updateAnalytics('player_connected')`
- **Last Updated**: Automatically set on each analytics update

## üîÑ Data Import Process

The NBA player data was imported using:
```bash
npm run firebase:import
```

This script:
1. Reads `../NBA Database/nba_data/players.csv`
2. Parses 4,775 player records
3. Batches them (500 per batch for Firestore limits)
4. Uploads to Firestore `players` collection
5. Logs the import action

**Import Time**: ~30-60 seconds for all players

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" errors:
- Check Firestore rules are deployed: `npm run firebase:deploy`
- Verify `.env.local` has correct Firebase config
- Ensure you're logged into Firebase: `firebase login`

### Player autocomplete not working:
- Verify players are imported: Check admin dashboard
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure Firebase config is loaded

### Assessment not saving:
- Check Firestore rules allow writes
- Verify network connection
- Check browser console for errors

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Review `/admin` dashboard for data status
3. Check Firebase Console for Firestore data
4. Review admin logs for recent actions
